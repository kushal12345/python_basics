    "<p> <strong> Tuple is non-mutable sequential/ordered data structure. </strong> Tuple is often confused with non-mutable list but they also have different use case scenarios. One of the common answers on internet about list vs tuple is tuples usually are used for heterogeneous data and List for homogeneous data. The homogenous/heterogenous distinction is really about the semantics of the data, not just the types. A sequence of a name, occupation, and address would probably be considered heterogenous, even though all three might be represented as strings. So it's more important to think about what you're going to do with the data (i.e., will you actually treat the elements the same) than about what types they are. For Example: </p>"
